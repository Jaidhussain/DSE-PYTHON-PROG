### Question - 4
'''
 Given two sets, set1 and set2, write a Python program to find their union, intersection and difference.
'''
def main():
    set1={1,2,5,4,5,11}
    set2={9,6,5,10,3,1}
    union_set=set1 | set2  # union of set1 and set2
    intersection_set=set1 & set2 # intersection of set1 and set2
    print(f"Intersection of set1 and set2 is - {intersection_set}")
    print(f"Union of set1 and set2 is - {union_set}")

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
